# Regressions

This project contains examples of Linear, Polynomial, and Logistic Regression models.

## Technologies Used

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib.pyplot`
- `sklearn`

## Project Structure

The projects organized into the following directories:

- **input**: Contains the input data files.

- **models**: Stores the trained models.

- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model development.

- **output**: Contains the output files generated by the models.

- **src**: Python scripts for training, predicting with the models and etc.

## Examples

### Linear Regression

In this example, we predict employees' salaries based on their years of experience. The dataset used is `salary.csv`, which contains two columns: `YearsExperience` and `Salary`.

### Polynomial Regression
