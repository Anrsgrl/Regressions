# Linear Regression

![Linear Banner](../screenshots/linear.webp)

This directory contains the implementation of Linear Regression to predict employees' salaries based on their years of experience.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this example is `salary.csv`, which contains two columns:

- `YearsExperience`: The number of years an employee has worked.
- `Salary`: The salary of the employee.

## Files and Directories

- **input**: Contains the input data file.

  - `salary.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the linear regression model.

- **models**: Stores the trained models.

  - `linear_model.pkl`: The trained linear regression model saved using `joblib`.

- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model development.

  - `exploration.ipynb`: A notebook that includes data exploration, visualization, and the steps to develop the linear regression model.

- **output**: Contains the output files generated by the models.

  - `predictions.csv`: The predictions made by the linear regression model on the test data.

- **src**: Python scripts for training and predicting with the models.
  - `train.py`: Script to train the linear regression model.
  - `predict.py`: Script to make predictions using the trained model.

## Model Training

The `train.py` script loads the data from `salary.csv`, preprocesses it, and trains a linear regression model. The trained model is then saved as `linear_model.pkl` in the `models` directory.

## Making Predictions

The `predict.py` script loads the trained model from `linear_model.pkl` and uses it to make predictions on new data. The predictions are saved in `predictions.csv` in the output directory.

## Results

The results of the predictions can be found in the `predictions.csv` file in the output directory. This file contains the predicted salaries for the employees based on their years of experience.
